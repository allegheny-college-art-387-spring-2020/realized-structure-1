# ART 387: Impossible Architecture - Realized Structure 1

* Point value: 100 pts.
* Assigned: 15 January 2020
* Due: 29 January 2020

## The Memory Palace

> "Literature tells us we will remember the house of our childhood..."
>
> Lisa Robertson, "Playing House: A Brief Account of the Idea of the Shack"

Of course, Robertson is speaking directly to Bachelard on the same oneiric plane that our reading from _The Poetics of Space_ describes. As such, your task is to create a "notional" reconstruction of a living place from "daydream" or your past.

### Supporting readings

* [Week 1](https://github.com/allegheny-college-art-387-spring-2020/course-materials/tree/master/Readings/Week%201)

## Guidelines

### Material Budget

* Level 1

### Design

- [ ] A physical model occupying no less than 16 in2 and no more than 25 in2
    * There are no limits to the physical height of the structure, except those imposed by the physical building surrounding our terrain.
- [ ] Generate at least two drawings serving as sketches used during building
- [ ] Once installed on the course terrain, take photos of your model for this project and your own portfolio
* You **may not** use any direct references of the location you’re building
* You must use 3 more abstract "reference points" for this assignment
    *These may be music, visual art, novels, a Furby, or any set of "things" (interpret the term broadly) which represent the "daydreams" of the place you’re interpreting

### Writing

- [ ] A foam-mounted label containing:
    * the title of the structure
    * measurement of physical area taken up by the structure
    * materials used
    * your name
- [ ] A statement of less than 200 words (exluding structure title) using key selections from readings and references to describe the process and outcome of the structural project
* Below the statement, list all "reference points" used in the creation or design of the structure under a clearly-defined heading

#### Nota bene

Keep in mind that all documentation (including, but not limited to the label) is potentially a part of the finished product. While not part of this project's evaluation, think of these materials as an opportunity to create an architectural design identity.

### Submitting the assignment

* Materials must be turned in using the GitHub repository under which this project was assigned.
* All references must be placed in the references directory of the repository
* The statement should replace **this** `README.md` file
* All sketches should be placed in a `studies` directory
* All materials used to create/install should be placed in an `installation` directory (digital files used to produce objects (including 3D models, vector/raster files, et al.)
* The structure must be installed on the course terrain no later than 11:59 P.M. on the project due date

## Evaluation

This project will be evaluated based on:

- [ ] Completeness
- [ ] Insightful use of references in writing portion(s) to inform the design/viewer
- [ ] Documentation of process
