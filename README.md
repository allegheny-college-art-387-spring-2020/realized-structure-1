# ART 387: Impossible Architecture - Realized Structure 1

* Point value: 100 pts.
* Assigned: 22 January 2020
* Due: 5 February 2020, 5:00 PM

## The Memory Palace

> "Literature tells us we will remember the house of our childhood..."

> Lisa Robertson, "Playing House: A Brief Account of the Idea of the Shack"

Of course, Robertson is speaking directly to Bachelard on the same oneiric plane that our reading from _The Poetics of Space_ describes. As such, your task is to create a "notional" reconstruction of a living place from "daydream" or your past.

### Supporting readings

* [Week 1](https://github.com/allegheny-college-art-387-spring-2020/course-materials/tree/master/Readings/Week%201)

For creating clear "Markdown"-based files, I suggest a read through:

* [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## Guidelines

### Material Budget

* Level 1

### Design

- [ ] A physical model occupying no less than 16 in<sup>2</sup> and no more than 25 in<sup>2</sup>
    * There are no limits to the physical height of the structure, except those imposed by the physical building surrounding our terrain.
- [ ] Generate at least two drawings serving as sketches used during building
- [ ] Once installed on the course terrain, take photos of your model for this project and your own portfolio
* You **may not** use any direct references of the location you’re building
* You must use 3 more abstract "reference points" for this assignment
    * These may be music, visual art, novels, a Furby, or any set of "things" (interpret the term broadly) which represent the "daydreams" of the place you’re interpreting

### Writing

- [ ] A foam-mounted label containing:
    * the title of the structure
    * measurement of physical area taken up by the structure
    * materials used
    * your name
- [ ] A document containing:
    * A poem written "to" the structure
	    * This can take any form
	    * The poem must feature a line from the Bachlard reading as an "epigraph"
		* Must not feature the name or external physical characteristics of the structure, beyond the title
    * A list of items that would appear _inside_ this realized structure
    * A second list of "reference points" used in the creation or design of the structure under a clearly-defined heading

#### Nota bene

Keep in mind that all documentation (including, but not limited to the label) is potentially a part of the finished product. While not part of this project's evaluation, think of these materials as an opportunity to create an architectural design identity.

### Submitting the assignment

* Materials must be turned in using the GitHub repository under which this project was assigned.
* Pictures of or representations of all references must be placed in the references directory of the repository
* The poem and various lists should replace **this** `README.md` file
* All sketches should be placed in a `studies` directory
* All materials used to create/install should be placed in an `installation` directory (digital files used to produce objects (including 3D models, vector/raster files, et al.)
* The structure must be installed on the course terrain no later than 5:00 PM on the project due date

## Evaluation

This project will be evaluated based on:

- [ ] Completeness, taken to mean:
    * Building installed on the course terrain by the deadline
	* Accompanying materials turned in on GitHub by the deadline
- [ ] Insightful use of references and writing to inform the design/viewer
- [ ] Documentation of process
